Hello!

This is our second article focusing on showcasing some of the art we have for our upcoming turn-based strategy title. If you missed our previous look at our first deity, you may want to check that article out ([https://www.tzyi.dev/posts/fand/](https://www.tzyi.dev/posts/fand/ "https://www.tzyi.dev/posts/fand/")), where we explain the original concept of including Celtic goddesses in our game, and their incorporation into our skill tree system.

Today we’re showcasing the art we have for the Goddess that governs Conflict, Morrigan:

As with Fand, we initially commissioned a black & white concept piece of each of our Goddesses. The art brief we provided for Morrigan is below:

_Morrigan - Phantom Queen (Conflict)_

_Goddess of War & Fate_

_Woman facing the viewer wearing a deep cowl, a smirk visible on her otherwise shrouded face._

_Want her to give off a vibe of allure, power, seduction/temptation._

_Two hands extended, palms upwards as if offering a choice._

_Above one hand floats skulls, weaponry, arrows, anything related with war and conflict._

_Above the other hand floats shreds of paper covered in celtic runes, prophetic objects (crystals/orbs?), and small ravens/crows._

While our previous Goddess Fand was a relatively minor figure in Celtic Mythology, Morrigan plays a much more central role. Often referred to as “The Morrigan”, she often takes the appearance of a crow, a bird associated with omens and foretelling. She features in both the Ulster Cycle and the Mythological Cycle in Irish Mythology as a harbinger of war and fate, interacting with many key figures, including Cúchulainn as Fand did.

We initially received a more red-toned version of Morrigan, and while it looked good, we wanted a slightly darker tone for our Goddess, incorporating purples and a darker hair colour while also fleshing out the background.

This was the final piece that we decided to go with. We loved how different the colour piece of Morrigan turned out when compared and contrasted with Fand. The striking differences between the two give them their own distinct identity.
