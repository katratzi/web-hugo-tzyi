Hello, and welcome to our combat test for our upcoming title!

While going through the design process we came up with two different styles of combat. The first was an Advance Wars-esque system which you'll be testing here today!

The idea of this test is to give us enough raw data regarding how the combat "feels" in this system to decide if we should continue as we are or pivot to the other system we had in mind.

When beginning this combat test you'll be shown 5 different combat scenarios, ordered in difficulty and complexity from left to right.

In each of these scenarios you'll be asked to field an army of units to defeat the opposing army of units. Each unit has its own strengths and weaknesses that are displayed both on the unit card and on the "combat triangle".

Once you've assembled your army of units, select which type of unit to buff on your side in the top left and click "playBattle" to engage in a round of combat. Repeat this process until one side is victorious!
