We are Richard and Matt, working together to build a wee wonderful turn based strategy game.  With numerous years of experience in the industry between us we got together and decided that we'd love to make a retro inspired turn based game with modern design elements. 

## What

We want to make game based on ancient Scottish myths and history.  We've both lived and worked in Scotland for numerous years and love the country, it seemed like a rich source to base a wee game from. 

## When

It's very early days on our development journey but we hope to have something publicly playable near the end of the this year, and cautiously looking to release in early 2023.  Please join us on our journey, follow us on social media, bookmark our site, and you'll join the other lovely game fans in learning first hand what's happening.
