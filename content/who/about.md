I'm Richard, a developer with experience in Unity, web and now SwiftUI.  Welcome to my little site to post about software development and the little side projects I'm working on.

## What

My current focus is on native iOS and iPadOS apps using SwiftUI.  But you might also see some web or other stuff.

## Past

We were Richard and Matt, working hard to make a wee wonderful turn based strategy game, called Mantle of the Celts.  With numerous years of experience in the industry between us we got together and decided that we'd love to make a retro inspired turn based game with modern design elements. Despite our hard work it wasn't progressing as we'd liked. As the saying goes, when you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.  One day we'll shake off the dust and try again for sure.
