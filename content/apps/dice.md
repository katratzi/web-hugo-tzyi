A wee wonderful app for rolling dice, just in case you forgot to brings yours. 


## How to Use

Tap the dice buttons at the bottom of the screen to add dice.  Delete using the little trash can, it removes dice from last added.  To roll, just tap away at the screen.  If you want different colored dice *long press* on the button for options.

To add and remove board use the little + & - icons in the top right corner.  A quick tap on the plus adds the default board.  You can long press to load an empty one or a saved board.

## Defaults & Saving a board 

Tap the 'cog' in the top left corner to bring up the settings menu.  At the very top it tells you what the current board is and the dice in play.  You can save that board to reuse it later.  Tap no any of the saved boards and they will be created as a new one.

If you want to *delete* a save board just swipe to the right.  Swiping to the left to set a board as the default.  Swipe the current default board to the right to reset it back, the regular default is two D6.  Enjoy!
