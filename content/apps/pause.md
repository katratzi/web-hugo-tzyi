Sometimes all you need is a pause. Pause by TzYi helps you break the reflex of doom-scrolling. Choose distracting websites and insert a short pause before they load. Instead of instantly refreshing Reddit, Twitter, or news sites, you'll see a gentle countdown and a mindful message — just enough time to breathe, reset, and decide if you really want to continue.

No blocking. No guilt. Just a moment of space between impulse and action.

## How to Use

Pause is a lightweight Safari extension that gives you a moment of reflection before visiting distracting websites. Start by adding the sites you want to pause, then customize your delay and messages to create a mindful browsing experience.

## Adding Sites

From the main view, you can add websites to your pause list. Enter the domain or URL in the input field — for example, "twitter.com" or "www.reddit.com". Choose whether to match the entire domain or just the exact URL, then tap "Add Site" to add it to your paused sites list.

Once added, your paused sites will appear in a list below. Each entry shows whether it's matching the entire domain or an exact URL. You can remove any site by tapping the red "Remove" button on the right side of each entry.

## Settings

Switch to the Settings tab to customize your pause experience. Here you can adjust the global delay timer and manage your splash messages.

### Global Delay

Set how long the pause countdown should last. Enter the number of seconds in the delay field — the default is 10 seconds — and tap "Save Delay" to apply your changes.

### Splash Messages

Add personalized mindfulness messages that will appear during the pause. These gentle reminders help you take a moment to breathe and reconsider before continuing. Enter your custom message in the text field and tap "Add Message" to add it to your collection. You can add multiple messages, and they'll be shown in succession during pauses. To remove a message, simply tap the red "Remove" button next to it.
