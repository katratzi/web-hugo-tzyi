A wee wonderful app for rating and remembering anything — movies, snacks, trips, whatever you like. Syncs with iCloud on iPhone and iPad.

## How To Use

**Create a folder -** Folders allow you to group ratings together, e.g. movies, local restaurants or snacks.

**Add a rating -** Give it a name and a rating of course. Add any notes that you want to add. Lastly provide some tags for filtering.

**Tags -** These can be added simply be seperating them with spaces. For example <tt>"movie scifi spielberg"</tt> would create three tags that you can filter by in the main ratings list.

**Personalise -** Don't like the default range? No problem, go to settings (gear icon) and you can alter the prefered range and add a decimal. Changing the range doesn't alter the rating values.

**Tips -** Swipe left &#x2190; to delete ratings. Swipe right &#x2192; to duplicate a rating and its tags, useful for similar items.

Here is a short walkthrough :)
