## How to Use

Chapters is a minimalist writing tool.  It's purposefully simple to allow you to focus on writing without distraction.  Start by tapping 'Create Book' from the library view.  Here you add your title, and optionally a subtitle or even some cover art for inspiration.

## Chapters

Once created, tap to head into the main editing view.  On the left you'll see your chapters, which you can add, edit, reorder and delete with a few simple controls.  *Swipe right* to delete.  *Swipe left* to change the chapter name and also add your own notes.

The text editing part itself is *pure text* with no formatting.  

## Stats

In the stats panel you can see your overall progress, we use a simple 250 words per page calculation.  Within here there is a little goal tool that you use to help you make regular progress on your next amazing story.  Just select the page count you're aiming for and hit begin.

Now in the main editing view, at the bottom, you'll see a small progress bar that fills in as you type.  With a beautiful and gentle completion effect to indicate you're done without overly distracting you if you are in the flow.

## File

Your book is backed up with iCloud if you're signed in with Apple and syncs across your devices seamlessly.  However if you're writing a major work you can also enjoy the additional safety of exporting the book as a backup.  Note the file is simple .json and you can open that in any other text editor. 

Once you're finished with masterpiece you are likely to want to save it for final formatting.  Simply 'Save as text' and you'll get a lovingly setup text file with your chapter names and notes, along with some simple text tags to search for to create the final story.
