## How To Use

**Create a folder -**  Folders allow you to group ratings together, e.g. movies, local restaurants or snacks.

**Tags -** These can be added simply be seperating them with spaces. For example <tt>"movie scifi spielberg"</tt> would create three tags that you can filter by in the main ratings list.

**Personalise -** Don't like the default range? No problem, go to settings (&#x2699; gear icon) and you can alter the prefered range and add a decimal. Changing the range doesn't alter the rating values.
    
**Tips -** Swipe left &#x2190; to delete ratings. Swipe right &#x2192; to duplicate a rating and its tags, useful for similar items.
