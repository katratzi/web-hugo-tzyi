## How To Use

### 1) Create your Exercises

Go to the *Exercises* tab. From here you can create different exercises for your gym workout. You can allocate an icon for the general type.

- All
- Upper
- Lower
- Core
- Cardio

Then choose 1 or 2 things you'd like to track. For most equipment this will weight and reps. For cardio, (e.g. treadmill) this will be distance and time.

### 2) Start your Workout

From the *Workout* tab you can start your workout or create a routine from the exercises you've created if you want to re-use the same set of exercises. From within a workout you have access to a simple rest timer. Simply fill in the details of your sets as you go.

End of Workout - you'll see the achievements you gained for that workout and a short summary of your sets and any new personal bests.

Day 1 to 5 - For each workout you do during a week you will earn these achievements, so the first workout you do earns you day 1, 2nd workout day 2 etc. The week begins on a Monday. You can collect this achievement multiple times throughout a season.

Week 1 to 12 - The first time you do a workout for a new week in the season you will earn these badges. There are 12 to collect and most seasons are 13 weeks look so if you need to take a break to recover you can do so, they do not need to be done sequentially.
